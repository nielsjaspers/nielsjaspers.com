            <p>
                Hi there! Iâ€™m Niels, a second-year Computer Science student from the Netherlands with a passion for programming and technology! ðŸš€<br />
                Iâ€™m always excited to experiment with new tools and technologies. Currently, Iâ€™m diving deep into Go, with a new upcoming project. ðŸ‘€<br />
                <br />
                My journey in software development is driven by a love for problem-solving and a curiosity to learn new things. I also have a special place in my heart for Neovim, my go-to tool for writing code. (btw)<br />
                <br />
                In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy working on my (open-source) projects, learning about emerging trends, and challenging myself to think outside the box.<br />
                <br />
                Feel free to explore my skills and projects below (and stay tuned for my upcoming blog!), or <a href="#contact">get in touch</a> to learn more about me and what Iâ€™m working on!
