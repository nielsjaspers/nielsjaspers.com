            <h1>hi, i'm niels</h1>
            <p>
                i'm just a computer science student from the netherlands,
                creating (mostly open source) things.
            </p>
            <p>
                a few years ago, i built my first program. it was just a
                block i could move with w, a, s, d. absolutely nothing
                fancy, but the feeling of creating something i could
                actually use was kind of magical. that simple block opened
                up a whole world for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                like many people starting out, i got stuck in what they call
                "tutorial hell" for a while. then, about a year and a half
                ago, something just clicked. i can't pinpoint the exact
                moment, but suddenly i realized i hadn't looked at a real
                tutorial in months. i was just building things on my own.
            </p>
            <p>
                around the same time, i started having moments where i
                needed something, but the existing solutions didn't quite
                fit my needs or were too expensive. so i'd think, "how hard
                could it be to make my own?" turns out, usually not that
                hard. the more i created, the more my perspective shifted
                from consuming to making.
            </p>
            <p>
                i've always believed that the tech industry is one of the
                most exciting things in the world. we're living through
                incredible changes right now. for example, right now the ai
                revolution is making development more accessible than ever
                before. what started as a simple text generator is now
                integrated into almost every piece of software and hardware
                you can think of.
            </p>
            <p>
                i'm not a doomer who thinks ai will replace all jobs
                tomorrow, nor do i think it's all hype. i'm a tech optimist.
                i believe that all this new technology will leapfrog us in
                ways we can't imagine right now, and most importantly, it's
                making 'creation' accessible to more people than ever.
            </p>
            <p>
                and that’s what really gets me excited: the human ability to
                create. this unique ability is becoming amplified by all
                these new tools, allowing for even more, even better ideas
                and creations.
            </p>
            <p>
                creating your own things is one of the coolest things we can
                do as humans. whether it's software, hardware, something
                made out of wood, knitting a doll, or writing a story - we
                have this unique curiosity and drive to make something from
                nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
                that's why my philosophy is simple: "creating > consuming."
            </p>
            <p>
                instead of just using expensive solutions that don't quite
                fit, why not build your own? instead of waiting for someone
                else to create what you need, why not be the one to bring it
                into existence? that moment when you realize something you
                want doesn't exist yet - that's not a problem, that's an
                opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                this is why, at the time of writing, i'm planning on
                starting a company with a good friend of mine. i won't spoil
                any surprises, but we're going to create some cool things.
                and someday, i hope to share what i've learned through
                blogs, talks, and by helping other students who are where i
                was just a few years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                my absolute goal in life is to enable people so they can
                give their all and create what they want. because i truly
                believe that you - yes, you reading this - have something
                unique to contribute to the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                the question isn't whether you're capable of creating
                something amazing. the question is..
            </p>
            <p>what are you going to build?</p>
