            <h1>hi, i'm niels</h1>
            <p>
                i'm just a computer science student from the netherlands,
                creating (mostly open source) things.
            </p>
            <p>
                a few years ago, i built my first program. it was just a block i
                could move with w, a, s, d. absolutely nothing fancy, but the
                feeling of creating something i could actually use was kind of
                magical. that simple block opened up a whole world for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                like many people starting out, i got stuck in what they call
                "tutorial hell" for a while. then, about a year and a half ago,
                something just clicked. i can't pinpoint the exact moment, but
                suddenly i realized i hadn't looked at a real tutorial in
                months. i was just building things on my own.
            </p>
            <p>
                around the same time, i started having moments where i needed
                something, but the existing solutions didn't quite fit my needs
                or were too expensive. so i'd think, "how hard could it be to
                make my own?" turns out, usually not that hard. the more i
                created, the more my perspective shifted from consuming to
                making.
            </p>
            <p>
                i've always believed that the tech industry is one of the most
                exciting things in the world. we're living through incredible
                changes right now. for example, right now the ai revolution is
                making development more accessible than ever before. what
                started as a simple text generator is now integrated into almost
                every piece of software and hardware you can think of.
            </p>
            <p>
                i'm not a doomer who thinks ai will replace all jobs tomorrow,
                nor do i think it's all hype. i'm a tech optimist. i believe
                that all this new technology will leapfrog us in ways we can't
                imagine right now, and most importantly, it's making 'creation'
                accessible to more people than ever.
            </p>
            <p>
                and thatâ€™s what really gets me excited: the human ability to
                create. this unique ability is becoming amplified by all these
                new tools, allowing for even more, even better ideas and
                creations.
            </p>
            <p>
                creating your own things is one of the coolest things we can do
                as humans. whether it's software, hardware, something made out
                of wood, knitting a doll, or writing a story - we have this
                unique curiosity and drive to make something from nothing.
            </p>
            <p>that's why my philosophy is simple: "creating > consuming."</p>
            <p>
                instead of just using expensive solutions that don't quite fit,
                why not build your own? instead of waiting for someone else to
                create what you need, why not be the one to bring it into
                existence? that moment when you realize something you want
                doesn't exist yet - that's not a problem, that's an opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                this is why, at the time of writing, i'm planning on starting a
                company with a good friend of mine. i won't spoil any surprises,
                but we're going to create some cool things. and someday, i hope
                to share what i've learned through blogs, talks, and by helping
                other students who are where i was just a few years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                my absolute goal in life is to enable people so they can give
                their all and create what they want. because i truly believe
                that you - yes, you reading this - have something unique to
                contribute to the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                the question isn't whether you're capable of creating something
                amazing. the question is..
            </p>
            <p>what are you going to build?</p>
