                <p>
                    i need to get something off my chest before i lose my mind
                    completely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i'm a computer science student in the netherlands. i'm in my
                    second year, about to start my third, and these years have
                    been the biggest regrets of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    this is not because i hate learning or anything. i fucking
                    love learning. but what i'm paying thousands for each year
                    isn't education, it's institutional theater performed by
                    people who seem as confused as I am.
                </p>
                <h2>let me paint you a picture</h2>
                <p>
                    our years get divided into 4 project. these project are
                    supposed to last for 10 weeks. the following was quite
                    literally how my latest project went.
                </p>
                <p>
                    week 1: opening of the project. we hear a rough outline of
                    what we will have to build in the coming weeks. "a
                    predictive ai/ml model for a real client". cool, but what
                    are the requirements?
                </p>
                <p>
                    week 2: no classes, no info. just... nothing. i'm paying
                    tuition to sit at home, waiting and refreshing my email for
                    updates that never come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    week 3: i head to the campus, sit in a classroom for exactly
                    5 minutes while our instructor tells us the project
                    requirements aren't ready yet, then drive home. five.
                    minutes. i spent more time in traffic than in class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    week 4-6: we were told that we would get data from the
                    client, on which we could build the model. we didn't get the
                    data, and we just kept being redirected to other people once
                    we asked where the data was so that we could start with the
                    project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    week 7: we finally got the data... or so we thought. it was
                    not useful at all, so they pivoted and said; 'build an api
                    scraper instead to get the data'
                </p>
                <p>
                    seven weeks, and the only hard requirement we got was 'build
                    a scraper.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    and do you want to know the best part? we had to make it
                    with chatgpt. not alongside chatgpt as a tool. we were
                    literally required to have ai write our code. if you don't
                    comply, you fail the project.
                </p>
                <p>i wish i was making this up.</p>
                <p>
                    in a computer science program, i'm being mandated to watch
                    ai write code instead of learning to write it myself. the
                    instructor actually said, "why would you waste time coding
                    when chatgpt can do it for you?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    because maybe, just maybe, i want to understand what the
                    fuck i'm doing?
                </p>
                <h2>the beautiful trap</h2>
                <p>
                    here's why i can't just leave: i'm locked into this system
                    because dropping out means paying back 10-20k in student
                    debt immediately. the dutch system is set up so that if you
                    don't complete your degree, you owe the government every
                    cent they've given you for living expenses and tuition
                    support. right now, immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    so i'm trapped, paying money i don't have for an education
                    i'm not getting, watching semesters of my life drain away
                    while i learn absolutely nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the worst part? i genuinely love this stuff. i love the
                    satisfaction of solving problems, the thrill of finally
                    understanding how something works, the magic of building
                    something from nothing. but this system is designed to crush
                    exactly that curiosity.
                </p>
                <h2>everything i know, i taught myself</h2>
                <p>
                    every useful skill i have came from late nights at my desk,
                    not lecture halls. every project i'm proud of was built in
                    my spare time, not for a grade. while my professors were
                    figuring out their own curriculum, i was:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        building a peer-to-peer file sharing application on top
                        of the at protocol because i was curious about
                        decentralized systems
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        creating a gradient background generator when i needed
                        one for a personal project
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        actually learning to code by writing code, debugging
                        code, and occasionally wanting to throw my laptop out
                        the window
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    these aren't revolutionary projects, but they're mine. i
                    built them because i wanted to understand how things work,
                    not because someone with tenure told me i had to. each one
                    taught me more in a weekend than i've learned in entire
                    semesters of classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the difference is stark: when i build something myself, i
                    actually care about whether it works. when it breaks, i want
                    to fix it. when it succeeds, i understand why. at school,
                    none of that matters because the goal isn't learning. it's
                    just getting through.
                </p>
                <h2>when everything feels fake</h2>
                <p>
                    this institutional failure has started bleeding into
                    everything else. when you're constantly told that your time
                    doesn't matter, when you're forced to go through the motions
                    of learning without actually learning anything, it becomes
                    hard to care about anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the gym feels pointless. why work out when nothing else in
                    your life feels like it's moving forward? social plans feel
                    empty. why go out when you're already exhausted from
                    fighting a system that's supposed to be helping you? even
                    personal projects feel overwhelming when you're already
                    running on fumes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i feel detached from everything, like i'm watching my own
                    life through glass. and i know i'm not alone in this. i see
                    it in my classmates' faces, that same glazed-over look of
                    people who've given up fighting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    it's this weird psychological thing where being trapped in
                    fake productivity makes you doubt your ability to do real
                    work. when your days are filled with meaningless busy work
                    that's dressed up as education, you start questioning
                    whether anything you do actually matters. the line between
                    "this is bullshit" and "maybe i'm just not cut out for this"
                    gets blurry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    some days i catch myself scrolling social media for hours,
                    not because i'm enjoying it, but because it feels like the
                    same level of emptiness as everything else. at least doom
                    scrolling doesn't pretend to be helping me grow.
                </p>
                <h2>the truth about where i am</h2>
                <p>
                    i wish i could be the guy who tells you i've figured it all
                    out, that i've defeated the system and that 'x, y and z' are
                    the three simple steps you need to take to fix your life
                    too.
                </p>
                <p>but that would be complete bullshit.</p>
                <p>
                    the truth is: i feel stuck and drained. some days it's hard
                    to care about anything at all. the education system is
                    broken, and being trapped in it doesn't make you stronger.
                    it just makes you tired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    most days i'm just trying to get through without falling
                    further behind on the things that actually matter to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    something that is really helping me stay sane is building
                    things. small projects i find interesting, or random tools
                    that solve tiny problems i have. they're not changing the
                    world, but they're keeping me tethered to the reason i
                    wanted to learn programming in the first place.

                <h2>why i'm building anyway</h2>
                <p>
                    when everything else feels like performance art - the
                    classes, the assignments, the whole academic theater -
                    building something with my own hands is the only time i
                    remember why i wanted to learn programming in the first
                    place.

                    that file sharing app? the gradient generator? the startup
                    i'm secretly working on? they weren't born from some grand
                    strategy or unshakeable motivation. they were built during 2
                    AM sessions when i couldn't sleep because i was too
                    frustrated with my day, and i needed to prove to myself that
                    i could still make something work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    building in public isn't my solution to anything. it's just
                    my way of documenting that i'm still trying, even when
                    everything feels pointless. it's me saying: "look, i'm still
                    here. i'm still building things. maybe that counts for
                    something."
                </p>
                <p>
                    i'm not doing this because i have some master plan or
                    because i think it'll lead to fame and fortune. i'm doing it
                    because creating something from nothing is the only activity
                    that still feels real to me. when i write a function that
                    works, when i solve a problem that's been bugging me, when i
                    build something that does exactly what i wanted it to do:
                    those moments remind me that i'm not broken, the system is.
                </p>
                <h2>to anyone else who's drowning</h2>
                <p>
                    if you're reading this and you're in a similar place,
                    trapped in a system that's crushing the thing you love,
                    watching your motivation drain away, feeling detached from
                    everything that used to matter, i can't offer you a magic
                    solution because i don't have one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    what i can tell you is that you're not broken for feeling
                    demotivated when you're stuck in something designed to crush
                    curiosity instead of nurture it. you're not alone in feeling
                    like the systems that are supposed to help you are actually
                    making everything worse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i don't know if building things in public will fix anything
                    for me. i don't know if sharing these projects will lead
                    anywhere meaningful. hell, i don't even know if i'll still
                    care about any of this in six months, or if i'll just burn
                    out completely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    but right now, it's the only honest thing i know how to do.
                    so i'm going to keep building small things, sharing them,
                    and hoping that the act of creating something, anything,
                    will help me remember who i am underneath all this
                    institutional exhaustion.
                </p>
                <p>maybe that's enough for now. maybe it has to be.</p>
