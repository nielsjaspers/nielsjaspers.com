                <p>
                    it's almost impossible to miss the buzz these days around
                    "artificial intelligence," or ai for short. ai can do all
                    sorts of things: summarize text, explain topics while
                    impersonating napoleon bonaparte, and create images of cats
                    on toilets reading a newspaper. but one of its most common
                    applications, especially in my field, is programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    this often involves using tools like chatgpt, github
                    copilot, claude, and others. you ask the chatbot to create
                    something, it generates code, and you repeat this process
                    until you have a functioning app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    you might think, "yeah, that's awesome! now everyone can be
                    a programmer!" and you'd be right. however, there's a small
                    problem...
                </p>
                <h2>the canvas and the code</h2>
                <p>
                    one of the reasons i got into computer science was because i
                    found it fascinating how, by typing some words on a screen,
                    i could make the computer do things. that moment was
                    special. i could command a computer to do exactly as i said
                    with just words. of course, computers are much more
                    complicated than that, but that first infinite 'hello world'
                    loop in python remains special.
                </p>
                <p>
                    this feeling of creation is like how an artist approaches a
                    blank canvas. programming can be a form of expressing
                    yourself, just like how an artist would with a painting.
                    this can be as high-level as what programming language you
                    choose, down to the way you structure your variables. but
                    the 'programming' part isn't the only art. in my opinion,
                    the unique way you solve problems when coding is also a
                    significant art form. it's like an artist choosing a
                    specific brushstroke or color palette to convey a particular
                    emotion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    but this is changing with the recent developments around ai,
                    with the new concept of "vibe coding."
                </p>

                <h2>embracing the "vibes", and the bugs</h2>
                <p>
                    the concept of "vibe coding" was introduced by andrej
                    karpathy (<a
                        href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383"
                        >@karpathy</a
                    >), an ai researcher. it's described as a new way to develop
                    software, where programmers explain what they want to create
                    in natural language, and ai tools generate the code. using
                    this method, anyone can program without needing prior
                    knowledge of traditional coding, where understanding the
                    code is crucial for maintenance and debugging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    supporters of "vibe coding" often highlight that this new
                    ai-driven method leads to faster development cycles and
                    greater accessibility for people outside the tech field.
                    however, opponents caution about the risks associated with
                    "vibe coding" and responsible software development. relying
                    entirely on ai presents several challenges. if a project
                    exceeds the ai's context window, the ai may struggle to
                    maintain the entire project in its memory, leading to
                    errors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    these errors can range from minor bugs to significant
                    vulnerabilities. a notable example occurred in march 2025
                    when a twitter user, leojr94_,
                    <a href="https://x.com/leojr94_/status/1900767509621674109"
                        >tweeted</a
                    >
                    about creating their saas entirely with cursor, despite
                    having no prior programming knowledge.
                    <a href="https://x.com/leojr94_/status/1901560276488511759"
                        >just two days later</a
                    >, they reported being "under attack," with people bypassing
                    subscriptions and gaining unauthorized access to their
                    database. however, these bugs and vulnerabilities are just
                    one aspect of the problem. while security breaches and
                    technical failures grab headlines, they represent symptoms
                    of a deeper issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the more fundamental concern lies in what "vibe coding" does
                    to our capacity for critical thinking. not just as
                    programmers, but as problem-solvers in an increasingly
                    ai-dependent world.
                </p>
                <h2>the concerning impact on critical thinking</h2>
                <p>
                    traditional programming is tightly connected with creative
                    problem solving. developers get confronted with challenges
                    that require innovative approaches and critical thinking to
                    come up with efficient solutions. this process includes
                    understanding the problem, coming up with possible
                    solutions, prototyping, and testing the implementation.
                    these steps demand deep analysis, logical reasoning, and
                    creative "out-of-the-box thinking." all of these steps,
                    however, are bypassed with "vibe coding". this shift raises
                    a concerning question: what happens to our ability to think
                    critically when we no longer need to exercise these mental
                    muscles? the implications extend far beyond tech, touching
                    every sector where ai can be deployed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    when programmers rely heavily on ai to generate solutions,
                    they risk becoming passive consumers rather than active
                    problem-solvers. the muscle of breaking down complex
                    problems into smaller, manageable pieces begins to atrophy.
                    without regularly exercising the mental processes of
                    debugging, optimizing, and understanding trade-offs between
                    different approaches, developers may find themselves
                    helpless when ai-generated code fails or when they encounter
                    problems that fall outside the ai's training data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    this phenomenon extends beyond programming. in mathematics,
                    students who rely too heavily on (ai) calculators may
                    struggle with number sense and mental arithmetic. similarly,
                    writers who depend entirely on ai for content creation may
                    lose their ability to craft compelling narratives or develop
                    their unique voice. the pattern is clear: when we outsource
                    our thinking to machines, we risk losing the very skills
                    that make us valuable as humans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the irony is that while ai makes programming more accessible
                    to beginners, it may paradoxically make experienced
                    programmers less capable over time. the next generation of
                    developers might know how to prompt an ai effectively but
                    struggle to understand why their code works, or more
                    importantly, why it doesn't. this creates a dangerous
                    dependency where the tools meant to enhance our capabilities
                    instead replace them entirely.
                </p>
                <h2>reclaiming the art: a call for balance</h2>
                <p>
                    the rise of ai in programming presents us with a crossroads.
                    we can choose the path of least resistance, letting ai
                    handle the complexities while we become mere coordinators of
                    generated code. or we can choose to preserve what makes
                    programming truly rewarding: the intellectual challenge, the
                    problem-solving journey, and the satisfaction of building
                    something with our own understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    this isn't a call to abandon ai entirely. these tools can be
                    extremely powerful allies when used thoughtfully: helping
                    with boilerplate code, suggesting optimizations, or serving
                    as a rubber duck for debugging. the key is maintaining
                    agency over the creative process rather than surrendering it
                    completely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    what makes us uniquely human in the age of ai isn't just our
                    ability to write code, but our curiosity to
                    understand why things works. our drive to explore
                    unconventional solutions. our capacity to learn from
                    failures and build intuition over time. these qualities
                    can't be replicated by pattern-matching algorithms, no
                    matter how sophisticated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the blank canvas of a new project should still inspire
                    wonder, not prompt us to immediately reach for an ai crutch.
                    the debugging session that keeps us up at night should be
                    seen as a puzzle to solve, not a task to delegate. the
                    moment when a complex algorithm finally clicks in our minds
                    remains irreplaceable, and it's worth fighting to preserve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    programming has always been about more than just making
                    computers do things. it's about expanding our own capacity
                    to think, to solve problems, and to create. let's not trade
                    that birthright for the convenience of having our thinking
                    done for us. the art of programming is worth preserving, one
                    carefully crafted line of code at a time.
